# How to get support from the Libero Community
The best place to start for support on any aspect of Libero is the [Libero Commmunity Slack workspace](https://libero.pub/join-slack/). Invitiations are open so just join the conversation and ask your question in the relevant channel.

The community has members from a number of organisations and the project lead, eLife, have their [teams listed in the Libero GitHub organisation](https://github.com/orgs/libero/teams/elife-sciences/teams). If you want to mention someone on Slack, in an issue or in a pull request, then you can find out who we are by using [the teams page](https://github.com/orgs/libero/teams/elife-sciences/teams).

If your question is about a specific part of Libero then raising an issue on the relevant repository is helpful, following the issue templates as a guideline. Anything that is more broadly applicable should be raised by following the instructions in the [Community repository](https://github.com/libero/community).

For all other enquiries you can email [hello@libero.pub](mailot:hello@libero.pub) or use the contact form on https://libero.pub/contact/
